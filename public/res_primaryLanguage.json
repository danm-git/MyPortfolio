    "description": "I love hiking, traveling, running but mostly spending time with my family and friends. I was born in Boulder, Colorado and grew up just outside in the town of Broomfield. I attended Colorado State University where I met my future wife, Linnia. \n \n After college, Linnia and I moved to Portland, OR and 2 years later she started Veterinary school at Oregon State University. We spent 2 years in Salem, OR followed by 2 years in Corvallis, OR where Linnia became a veterinarian! \n \n After graduation we decided to live in New York City and travel the world. We found a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in the end, we stayed for 5 fun filled years. \n \n We then decided to start a family. We moved out to Huntington, Long Island for 1 year before moving back to Colorado to be closer to grandparents.  We settled in a house north of Denver and now have 2 young energetic boys, a dog named Yeppi Queso, and a steady stream of foster kittens and dogs. \n \n",
